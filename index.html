					Fair-code is not a software license. It describes a software model
					where software:
				</div>
				<ul>
					<li>is generally free to use and can be distributed by anybody</li>
					<li>has its source code openly available</li>
					<li>can be extended by anybody in public and private communities</li>
					<li>is commercially restricted by its authors</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Fair-code Principles</h2>

				<div class="content">
					<div class="principle">
						<h3>Free and Sustainable</h3>
						<div>
							A sustainable software model for 2020 and beyond, we believe it is
							possible to respect the principles of freedom without being
							ideological. The fair-code software model promotes the use of
							profit as a means to continue development of software in a way
							that is compatible with their author’s short and long-term
							economic intentions. Although there are many successful projects
							which have traditionally worked as communities of unpaid
							professionals and experts, fair-code attempts to create a level
							playing ground for software authors of all backgrounds, including
							those that would like to make a living off of their work.
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="principle">
						<h3>Open but Pragmatic</h3>
						<div>
							We desire open specifications, discussion, and collaboration. All
							of these are good practice and help the software improve and the
							community grow.
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="principle">
						<h3>Community meets Prosperity</h3>
						<div>
							We want people to make money off of their software, but we
							recognize that the community benefits from a project's economic
							success. Within fair-code, creators have the exclusive right of
							commercializing their work, ensuring long-term profitability.
							Companies that wish to commercialize the software can contact the
							author and form a business relationship that benefits both
							parties!
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="principle">
						<h3>Meritocratic and Fair</h3>
						<div>
							We believe that authentic meritocracy is still possible in
							software, and that software authors and contributors should be
							respected and have influence for their contributions to a project.
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="section faq" id="faq">
				<h2>Fair-code FAQ</h2>

				<div class="content">
					<div class="question">
						<h3>
							What does fair-code mean to me as a user of fair-code software?
						</h3>
						<div>
							Fair-code projects can be used totally free: privately, and even
							within a company with 10,000 employees. If they, however, want to
							commercialize it and charge people money for a, for example,
							hosted version or do consulting, restrictions may apply. The
							restrictions can be different depending on the license and cost
							structure which the project uses.
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="question">
						<h3>Why fair-code?</h3>
						<div>
							There is currently an economic disconnect between the people who
							create a project and put the most work in and the people who want
							to make money using it. Fair-code can ensure that projects are
							long term financially viable for their authors to continue and
							implement new features, or at least somewhat economically
							advantageous to their authors should their software succeed. It’s
							not that they should share all of the profit with the authors, but
							that fair-code attempts to ensure profitable business
							relationships which benefits both persons and/or companies.
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="question">
						<h3>
							What is “fair” about taking away the right to commercialize?
						</h3>
						<div>
							One way of making software more fair is by allowing developers to
							profit. Many companies today invest resources into taking an
							existing project and copying the ongoing work of the project
							creators; afterwards, creating and maintaining a hosted version
							using their code. In a fair circumstance, should they benefit from
							using the software, they could add certain features, fix bugs and
							support the community of users enjoying the product. In many cases
							they do, but fair-code ensures that this can happen by bringing
							businesses to the negotiation table when it comes to
							commercializing software.
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="question">
						<h3>How does fair-code relate to open-source or free software?</h3>
						<div>
							We see fair-code as an alternative model which addresses key
							concerns which open-source and free software currently fail to
							address. We support the community at large, and it is strongly
							encouraged that fair-code projects donate and contribute to likely
							more financially strained free and open source siblings if
							possible. As fair-code is adopted by software projects, more
							people who appreciate open-source and free software will have the
							financial means to support the open-source projects that they rely
							on.
